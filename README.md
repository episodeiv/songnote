This is what might one day become my very own system of music
notation. It's meant to do a few simple things:

- It should be easy to jot down simple songs but possible
  to notate more complex ones
- It should render results that should be easy to read on stage

It's supposed to be somewhere between just playing things
off the top of my head and full-on musical notation.

The main components are boxes that represent a unit in the song,
for instance a loop of two or four bars, whatever makes sense
for that particular song.
These boxes can then be labeled with a (yet to determine) color
scheme and a bunch of additional hints for live players.

Yes, there's not much here yet, but we're working on it, ain't we?
